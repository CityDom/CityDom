define Mom_Info1 = "She is my mom, a very calm and neat person. As a mom, she's strict but also understanding. She had my sister, Claire, when she was just a teenager. Now, she's working hard to succeed in the business world."
define LilSis_Info1 = "She's my younger sister, the family's wild child with colorful hair and fancy nails. She's always gaming or hanging out at the mall, which is why she's struggling to keep up with school."
define BigSis_Info1 = "She's my older sister, the typical eldest sibling who seems to dislike everyone. Being the firstborn, she faced all the pressure, which led her to often take charge and act bossy at home, as if she has every right to."
define Maria_Info1 = "Maria somehow became my first friend at school, most likely due to our shared interests. At first, I thought she was the emo type who hates everything. While that's not entirely false, she's pretty chill."
define Alis_Info1 = "Alis just scares me. I don't know anything about her, and neither does Maria. She only speaks when necessary and always listens, but in a very creepy way. She seems to disappear between classes."
define Sophie_Info1 = "Sophie is the classic bimbo, a bubblehead. She puts on a nice persona, acting like a 'pick-me girl,' but behind that friendly mask, she looks down on everyone."
define Lola_Info1 = "Lola is the captain of the volleyball team. She is really nice to everyone who's nice to her, even me. She's pretty much the school hero, protecting people from Sophie and Selina's tyranny."
define Selina_Info1 = "Selina is just a rich snob. Her entire persona feels like it's pulled straight from a mean girl movie. She has a boyfriend who seems just as bad as her, but I don't know much about their relationship."
define Helena_Info1 = "Helena is the happy-go-lucky type. She's friends with pretty much everyone, and it seems sincere. Maybe she's the funny kid at school who gets mistreated at home, but that's just a guess."
define Dorothy_Info1 = "Dorothy is the class representative. She's pretty chill and friendly until the teacher speaks up. Then, she does a complete 180, and it becomes impossible to get along with her."
define Leya_Info1 = "Leya is one of the best gymnasts in the country. While she's confident in her skills, she's down to earth and coolâ€”maybe thanks to Lola, who seems to be her best friend."
define Greta_Info1 = "Greta is Selina's lapdog, which is a shame because she's a really hardworking girl. Maybe she follows Selina because of her financial situation or to copy her homework. Or maybe she just likes her."
define Jannice_Info1 = "Jannice, or Miss Thompson, is our English teacher. She looks pretty young, but she's not the cool young teacher every school has. I've heard she's single by choice, but I don't know the reason."
define Criss_Info1 = "Criss is Isabella's best friend. She comes to our house on weekends. She's pretty shy, so I don't get the chance to talk to her much. When I do, Isa intervenes. I feel like Criss is hiding something."
define Luna_Info1 = "Luna is the school nurse and also the biology teacher, since the original one had an accident. She seems really interested in me, but her mood swings quickly, and she pushes me away abruptly."
define Angeline_Info1 = "Angeline is the school principal. She seems stern and serious, but she has a soft side if you get to know her. Apparently, she knows my mom, but I don't know the full story."
define Scarlet_Info1 = "Scarlet is our art teacher. She seems really nice, but I think she's bipolar because she changes her personality for no reason. She also drops hints of being a closeted pervert."
define Tanya_Info1 = "Tanya is the PE teacher and also my older cousin. She used to make fun of me and beat me up when we were little. Now that she's older, she's grown into a beauty, but her personality hasn't changed."
define Anna_Info1 = "Anna is the twin who always has a smirk on her face. While she acts like a mean brat, if you got to know her, you'd realize she's just spoiled."
define Emma_Info1 = "Emma is the twin who always has a look of disgust on her face. While she's a mean brat, just like her sister, getting to know her would reveal she's also just spoiled."
define Asako_Info1 = "Not implemented yet."
define Sandra_Info1 = "Sandra is the manners class teacher and Leya's mother. She's insufferable, completely obsessed with feminism and hating men, especially me. I've heard she used to be a successful gymnast."
